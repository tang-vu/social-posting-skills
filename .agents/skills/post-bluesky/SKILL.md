# Bluesky Posting Skill

## Platform Overview
Bluesky (bsky.app) is a decentralized social platform built on the AT Protocol. It's growing rapidly among tech communities and is an excellent platform for reaching developers, designers, journalists, and early adopters. Think of it as what Twitter was in 2009-2012 — conversational, authentic, and community-driven. 20M+ users and growing.

## Platform Constraints
- **Character Limit**: 300 characters per post
- **Media**: Up to 4 images per post
- **Links**: Displayed as rich cards (use for blog posts, projects)
- **Hashtags**: NOT supported — do not use them
- **Threads**: Supported via reply chains
- **Custom Feeds**: Users can create and subscribe to algorithmic feeds
- **Decentralized**: Your account is portable across servers via AT Protocol

## Link Placement Strategy

> **RECOMMENDED: Put links in a REPLY to your own post.**

- Bluesky's 300-char limit makes every character precious -- links eat into this
- Links generate rich card previews which can dominate the post visually
- Best strategy: Post a conversational text-only post, then reply with the link
- Exception: If the link IS the content (sharing an article), a link post is fine
- The community values authentic conversation over link-sharing

## Posting Steps (Browser Automation)

1. Navigate to `https://bsky.app/`
2. Wait for page load (must be logged in)
3. Click the compose button (pencil/plus icon)
4. Wait for compose modal to open
5. Type content in the text area (ASCII English only, max 300 chars)
6. Click "Post" button
7. Verify post appears on your profile timeline

### Thread Posting (Reply Chain)

> Bluesky does NOT have a native "Add to thread" feature in the composer. Build threads by replying to yourself.

1. Post the first post normally
2. Navigate to YOUR OWN post (or find it on your profile)
3. Click the Reply button on your post
4. Type the next post in the reply composer
5. Click "Post"
6. Repeat for each additional post in the thread

**Thread Strategy Tips:**
- Number your posts: "1/", "2/", etc.
- First post = hook (must be compelling since there's no auto-unfold)
- Each reply should work as standalone AND connect to the chain
- Keep threads shorter (3-5 posts) since there's no "Post all" feature
- Link to full content in the last reply

## Content Format
```
{One clear statement, insight, or observation}

{Optional: supporting detail, context, or link}

No hashtags. Just write naturally.
```

## Key Differences from X/Twitter
- **NO hashtags** — Keywords in text are how people find content
- **NO default algorithm** — Chronological timeline by default
- **Custom feeds** let users opt into algorithmic curation
- **More conversational**, less performative than X
- **Community is heavily tech/design/journalism-focused**
- **Decentralized**: Your account is portable across servers
- **Moderation**: Community-driven labeling and moderation

## Content Strategy
- **Be conversational**: The vibe is closer to early Twitter (friendly, authentic)
- **Share insights**: Quick thoughts, reactions to industry news
- **Link to projects**: Rich card previews work well for showcasing work
- **Thread for depth**: Use reply chains for longer-form content
- **No growth hacking**: The community strongly rejects engagement bait
- **Engage in replies**: Bluesky rewards conversation over broadcasting

## Algorithm / Discovery Tips
- Default feed is chronological (no algorithmic boosting)
- Custom feeds (e.g., "What's Hot", "Science", "Tech") drive discoverability
- Posts liked or reposted by people you follow appear in your feed
- Starter packs can help new users find relevant accounts
- Consistent posting (2-5x daily) builds follower base organically

## Pre-Posting Engagement (Before You Post)

> Warm up by engaging 10-15 minutes before posting.

1. **Scroll through your feed** for 5-10 minutes
2. **Like 5-8 posts** from people in your niche
3. **Reply to 2-3 posts** with genuine, conversational thoughts
4. **Repost 1 post** from someone interesting
5. Then post your content

## Post-Posting Engagement (After You Post)

> Bluesky is chronological by default, so timing and conversation matter more than algorithmic boost.

1. **Reply to every comment** on your post
2. **Like comments** on your post
3. **Continue engaging** with others' posts (don't post-and-disappear)
4. If you want to build a thread, **reply to your own post** with follow-up content
5. **Add the link** in a reply to your original post (keeps main post clean)

## Account Nurturing (Daily Routine)

> Bluesky is still growing. Early consistent presence = outsized influence.

### Daily Minimum (10-15 min/day)
- Browse feed: 5 min
- Like 8-12 posts
- Reply to 3-5 posts (be conversational, authentic)
- Repost 1-2 interesting posts
- Post 1-3 original posts

### Weekly Goals
- 1-2 reply-chain threads per week
- Follow 5-10 relevant accounts
- Explore and subscribe to custom feeds in your niche
- Use alt text on all images

### Growth Pattern
```
Week 1-2: Follow relevant accounts, engage with replies
Week 3-4: Start posting (2-3/day) + reply chains
Month 2: Build a consistent posting cadence
Month 3+: Leverage custom feeds for topic-specific growth
```

### Community-Specific Tips
- Bluesky community STRONGLY rejects engagement bait
- Be authentic — the vibe is early Twitter (friendly, nerdy, honest)
- Share original thoughts, not recycled X content
- Custom feeds are your discovery tool — subscribe to relevant ones
- Starter packs help new users find you — create or join one
- The community values accessibility (always use alt text)

## Best Practices
- Post 2-5 times daily for visibility
- Engage in replies — Bluesky rewards conversation
- Follow and interact with people in your niche
- Share unique perspectives (not just cross-posted X content)
- Join relevant custom feeds for topic-specific discovery
- Use alt text on images (community values accessibility)

## What to Avoid
- Cross-posting identical content from X (community notices and dislikes this)
- Using hashtags (they're not functional on Bluesky)
- Engagement farming tactics
- Overly promotional posts without context
- Being combative or toxic (community self-moderates)

## Known Pitfalls
- Account setup requires an invite or sign-up at bsky.app
- Custom feeds may change or be community-moderated
- The AT Protocol means different clients may render content differently
- Playwright cannot type emoji or Unicode characters
- 300 char limit is strict — plan content carefully
