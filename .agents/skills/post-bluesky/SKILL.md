# Bluesky Posting Skill

## Platform Overview
Bluesky (bsky.app) is a decentralized social platform built on the AT Protocol. It's growing rapidly among tech communities and is an excellent platform for reaching developers, designers, journalists, and early adopters. Think of it as what Twitter was in 2009-2012 — conversational, authentic, and community-driven. 20M+ users and growing.

## Platform Constraints
- **Character Limit**: 300 characters per post
- **Media**: Up to 4 images per post
- **Links**: Displayed as rich cards (use for blog posts, projects)
- **Hashtags**: NOT supported — do not use them
- **Threads**: Supported via reply chains
- **Custom Feeds**: Users can create and subscribe to algorithmic feeds
- **Decentralized**: Your account is portable across servers via AT Protocol

## Posting Steps (Browser Automation)

1. Navigate to `https://bsky.app/`
2. Wait for page load (must be logged in)
3. Click the compose button (pencil/plus icon)
4. Wait for compose modal to open
5. Type content in the text area (ASCII English only, max 300 chars)
6. Click "Post" button
7. Verify post appears on your profile timeline

## Content Format
```
{One clear statement, insight, or observation}

{Optional: supporting detail, context, or link}

No hashtags. Just write naturally.
```

## Key Differences from X/Twitter
- **NO hashtags** — Keywords in text are how people find content
- **NO default algorithm** — Chronological timeline by default
- **Custom feeds** let users opt into algorithmic curation
- **More conversational**, less performative than X
- **Community is heavily tech/design/journalism-focused**
- **Decentralized**: Your account is portable across servers
- **Moderation**: Community-driven labeling and moderation

## Content Strategy
- **Be conversational**: The vibe is closer to early Twitter (friendly, authentic)
- **Share insights**: Quick thoughts, reactions to industry news
- **Link to projects**: Rich card previews work well for showcasing work
- **Thread for depth**: Use reply chains for longer-form content
- **No growth hacking**: The community strongly rejects engagement bait
- **Engage in replies**: Bluesky rewards conversation over broadcasting

## Algorithm / Discovery Tips
- Default feed is chronological (no algorithmic boosting)
- Custom feeds (e.g., "What's Hot", "Science", "Tech") drive discoverability
- Posts liked or reposted by people you follow appear in your feed
- Starter packs can help new users find relevant accounts
- Consistent posting (2-5x daily) builds follower base organically

## Best Practices
- Post 2-5 times daily for visibility
- Engage in replies — Bluesky rewards conversation
- Follow and interact with people in your niche
- Share unique perspectives (not just cross-posted X content)
- Join relevant custom feeds for topic-specific discovery
- Use alt text on images (community values accessibility)

## What to Avoid
- Cross-posting identical content from X (community notices and dislikes this)
- Using hashtags (they're not functional on Bluesky)
- Engagement farming tactics
- Overly promotional posts without context
- Being combative or toxic (community self-moderates)

## Known Pitfalls
- Account setup requires an invite or sign-up at bsky.app
- Custom feeds may change or be community-moderated
- The AT Protocol means different clients may render content differently
- Playwright cannot type emoji or Unicode characters
- 300 char limit is strict — plan content carefully
