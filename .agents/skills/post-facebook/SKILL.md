# Facebook Posting Skill

## Platform Overview
Facebook has 3B+ monthly active users. Best for community building, local audiences, and Facebook Groups. Organic page reach has declined, but Groups and personal profiles still drive engagement.

## AI Content Rules (2025)

> Meta requires mandatory "AI-generated" labels for synthetic content. Bot-generated repetitive content is actively targeted and penalized.

- AI-assisted content must be labeled as such
- Duplicate content posted by bot networks faces crackdown
- Accounts using spam tactics lose monetization eligibility
- AI labels apply to both images and text content

## Platform Constraints
- **Character Limit**: 63,206 characters (but shorter performs better)
- **Media**: Images, videos, stories, reels, polls, events
- **Links**: Rich preview cards (but reduce organic reach)
- **Groups**: Best distribution channel on Facebook
- **Hashtags**: Minimal impact on reach (use 1-2 max or skip)
- **Reels**: Short-form video gets preferential treatment in discovery

## Link Placement Strategy

> **DEFAULT: Put links in the FIRST COMMENT, not in the post body.**

- Facebook's algorithm deprioritizes posts with external links in the body
- Native content (text, images, videos) without links gets significantly more reach
- Best strategy: Post engaging text-only content, then add the link as the first comment
- If you must include a link in the body, add substantial commentary around it
- Links to YouTube are especially penalized -- upload videos natively instead

## Posting Steps (Browser Automation)

1. Navigate to `https://www.facebook.com/`
2. Wait for the home page to load (must be logged in)
3. Click on the "What's on your mind?" composer box
4. Wait for the composer to expand
5. Type the post content (ASCII English only)
6. Click "Post" button
7. Verify post appears on the timeline
8. **Immediately comment on your own post** with the link (if applicable)

### Posting to a Group
1. Navigate to `https://www.facebook.com/groups/{group_id}/`
2. Click on the "Write something..." composer
3. Type content
4. Click "Post"
5. **Note**: Post may show as "Pending admin approval" — this is normal for many groups
6. After approved, add a comment with your link

## Group Posting Details

- Many groups require **admin approval** for all posts
- Private groups need admin approval for new members to join and view content
- Group admins should post at least 2x/week to keep the group active
- Each group may have its own specific rules (check before posting)
- Posts that match the group's niche get better distribution

## Content Format

### Personal Profile Post
```
{Hook question or bold statement}

{Context or story -- 2-3 short paragraphs}

{Ask for opinions or experience sharing}
```

### Group Post
```
{Relevant question or valuable insight for the group}

{Details, context, or evidence}

{Explicit ask: "Has anyone experienced this?" or "What's your approach?"}
```

## Content Strategy
- **Groups > Pages > Profile** for reach
- **Native content wins**: Videos and images uploaded directly outperform links
- **Ask questions**: Posts that prompt replies get distributed more
- **Go local**: Facebook excels for local and community content
- **Facebook Live**: Live videos get 6x more engagement than regular videos
- **Reels**: Short-form video content gets boosted in discovery

## Algorithm / Discovery Tips
- Facebook prioritizes "meaningful interactions" (comments over likes)
- Posts from friends/family rank over pages in the feed
- Native video gets prioritized over YouTube links
- Engagement within first hour determines reach
- Avoid engagement bait ("Tag a friend who...") -- penalized by algorithm
- Irrelevant descriptions and excessive hashtags are penalized
- Community Notes system replacing third-party fact-checkers (2025)
- Reels content receives preferential algorithmic treatment

## Best Practices
- Post 1-2 times daily (over-posting reduces per-post reach)
- Reply to every comment
- Use Facebook Groups for community building
- Native video and images outperform text-only posts
- Schedule posts for 1-4 PM weekdays for best reach

## Reaction Strategy

> Facebook offers 7 reactions. Using varied reactions (not just Like) makes your engagement look more natural and human.

| Reaction | Best Used For |
|----------|---------------|
| 👍 Like | General approval, quick engagement |
| ❤️ Love | Strong appreciation, personal stories, milestones |
| 🤗 Care | Supportive content, someone sharing struggles |
| 😂 Haha | Funny content, memes, jokes |
| 😮 Wow | Surprising news, impressive achievements |
| 😢 Sad | Bad news, sympathetic content |
| 😡 Angry | Injustice, outrage-worthy content |

- **Mix your reactions**: Don't just Like everything — use Love, Haha, Wow to seem more engaged
- **Hover to react**: Hold your cursor over the Like button for 1-2 seconds to see the reaction bar
- **Reactions on comments**: You can also react to individual comments, not just posts

## Pre-Posting Engagement (Before You Post)

> Warm up the algorithm 15-30 minutes before posting.

1. **Scroll through feed** for 5-10 minutes
2. **React to 5-8 posts** (use varied reactions, not just Like)
3. **Comment on 2-3 posts** with genuine thoughts (3+ words, not just emoji)
4. **Share 1 post** with your own commentary
5. **Visit 1-2 Groups** you're in and engage there
6. Then post your content — you're now "warm" in the algorithm

## Post-Posting Engagement (After You Post)

> The first 60 minutes determine your post's reach (the "golden hour").

1. **Stay online** for at least 60 minutes after posting
2. **Reply to every single comment** — comments are 4x more valuable than likes
3. **React to comments** on your post (Love, Haha, etc.)
4. **Add context in comments**: Reply to your own post with additional info or links
5. **Continue browsing and engaging** with other posts
6. **Check back** 2-4 hours later for more comments
7. If you posted in a Group, **engage with other posts in that Group** too

## Account Nurturing (Daily Routine)

> Facebook rewards consistent, meaningful, conversation-driven activity.

### Daily Minimum (15-20 min/day)
- Browse feed: 5-10 min
- React to 10-15 posts (mix of reactions)
- Comment on 3-5 posts (genuine, 3+ words)
- Share 1 post with commentary
- Post 1-2 original posts

### Group Engagement (Critical for Reach)
- Participate in 2-3 Groups daily
- Comment on Group posts before posting your own
- Answer questions in Groups — build reputation
- Post in Groups 2-3 times per week

### Weekly Goals
- Post in 3-5 different Groups
- Share 2-3 native videos or image posts
- Respond to all DMs and messages
- Review analytics for best-performing content

### Growth Pattern
```
Week 1-2: Engage only — react, comment, join Groups
Week 3-4: Start posting (1/day) + continue engaging
Month 2: Add Group posting + native video
Month 3+: Full routine with Group leadership
```

### Engagement Quality Tips
- Comments should be 3+ words — "Nice!" doesn't count
- Ask follow-up questions in comments
- Tag friends ONLY if genuinely relevant
- Share personal experiences related to the post
- Don't use engagement bait ("Tag a friend who...")

## What to Avoid
- Engagement bait phrasing (Facebook penalizes this)
- Sharing links without adding commentary
- Cross-posting identical content from Instagram
- Overly promotional product posts without context
- Using more than 2 hashtags
- Bot-generated repetitive content
- Duplicate content across multiple accounts

## Known Pitfalls
- Facebook's composer may change layout frequently
- Privacy settings can affect post visibility
- Group posts may require admin approval (can take hours or days)
- Playwright cannot upload images via file picker dialogs
- AI-generated content without proper labels can be flagged
