# LinkedIn Posting Skill

## Platform Overview
LinkedIn is the professional networking platform with 1B+ members. It's the best platform for B2B thought leadership, career content, and professional brand building. LinkedIn organic reach is still excellent compared to other platforms.

## Platform Constraints
- **Character Limit**: 3,000 characters per post
- **Media**: Images, videos, documents (carousel PDFs), polls
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 per post (at the bottom)
- **Links**: Put in comments — links in body reduce reach by 25-35%
- **Linkless posts**: Get 6x more reach and 18x more comments than posts with links
- **Videos**: Native video gets 5x more reach than YouTube links
- **Carousels**: Document posts get 2-3x reach
- **80/20 Rule**: 80% native content, 20% with links (in comments)

## AI Content Warning (2025)

> LinkedIn's algorithm now scrutinizes AI-generated content. Overly generic or automated posts get reduced reach. Authentic, human-driven content is strongly prioritized.

- Posts analyzed for AI-generated material
- Generic, template-like content is penalized
- Add personal stories, specific details, and genuine voice to stand out
- Human oversight is essential even when using AI to draft

## Link Placement Strategy

> **MANDATORY: Put links in the FIRST COMMENT, NEVER in the post body.**

- Links in the body reduce reach by 25-35% (confirmed by LinkedIn's own algorithm)
- Linkless posts get 6x more reach and 18x more comments
- The ONLY correct strategy: Write a text-only post, publish it, then immediately add a comment with the link
- Even "link in bio" is better than link in body
- This is the single most important rule for LinkedIn reach

## Posting Method: MANUAL PASTE

> LinkedIn blocks browser automation via system policy. The agent generates content and saves it to `posts/drafts/linkedin_post.md`. You paste it manually.

### Manual Paste Steps
1. Agent generates LinkedIn-optimized content
2. Content saved to `posts/drafts/linkedin_post.md`
3. User opens linkedin.com in their browser
4. User pastes the content into the post composer
5. User adds any images or documents manually
6. User clicks "Post"

## Content Format

### The Story Post
```
{Hook: surprising outcome or lesson -- 1 line}

{Blank line -- this is critical for the "see more" click}

{Scene setting: where/when this happened}

{The challenge}

{What you tried}

{The turning point}

{The result with specific numbers}

{The takeaway for the reader}

{Engagement question}

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
```

### The Contrarian Take
```
{Bold opening statement}

Here's why most people get this wrong:

{Reason 1 with evidence}

{Reason 2 with evidence}

{What to do instead}

### The Carousel (Document Post)
```
Slide 1: Bold hook / title
Slide 2-8: One insight per slide (keep text large)
Slide 9: Summary
Slide 10: CTA (Follow for more, link in comments)
```

## Content Strategy
- **First line is everything**: This is what appears before "see more"
- **Use line breaks**: Short paragraphs (1-2 lines) for mobile readability
- **Be personal**: "I" posts outperform "we" posts
- **Share failures**: Vulnerability drives massive engagement
- **Give away knowledge**: The more you teach, the more authority you build
- **Comment on others**: Thoughtful comments on others' posts build visibility

## Algorithm / Discovery Tips
- LinkedIn shows your post to 10% of connections first
- If that 10% engages, it expands to more connections
- Comments carry 4x the weight of likes
- First 60 minutes are critical for reach (the "golden hour")
- Posts without links get 3x the reach
- Document posts (carousels) get 2-3x the reach
- **Dwell time** (how long users read your post) is a key ranking factor
- LinkedIn now shows older relevant posts (2-3 weeks old) over newer irrelevant ones
- Vertical videos getting increased priority in 2025
- Expertise: consistent posting on niche topics builds algorithmic authority

## Automation Restrictions

> LinkedIn's Terms of Service explicitly prohibit bots and automated methods for accessing the platform.

- Automation can lead to temporary restrictions or permanent bans
- Daily limits (2025): 10-20 connection requests, 50-100 messages
- Spread out actions to mimic natural behavior
- Scheduling content via official tools (LinkedIn's own scheduler) is acceptable

## Hashtag Strategy
| Industry | Recommended Hashtags |
|----------|---------------------|
| Tech/AI | #AI #MachineLearning #TechLeadership |
| Startups | #StartupLife #Entrepreneurship #BuildInPublic |
| DevRel | #DevRel #DeveloperExperience #OpenSource |
| Career | #CareerAdvice #JobSearch #Leadership |

## Pre-Posting Engagement (Before You Post)

> Do this 30-60 minutes before publishing your post.

1. **Scroll your feed** for 10-15 minutes
2. **Like 5-10 posts** from connections and industry leaders
3. **Comment on 3-5 posts** with thoughtful insights (50+ words for best impact)
4. **Share 1 post** with your own added commentary
5. **Reply to any pending comments** on your previous posts

> LinkedIn shows your post first to 10% of connections. If they engage, it expands. Being active before posting puts you in their feed already.

## Post-Posting Engagement (After You Post)

> The first 60 minutes are the "golden hour" — engagement here determines your total reach.

1. **Reply to every comment** within the first hour — this is the #1 factor
2. **Like every comment** on your post
3. **Ask follow-up questions** in your replies to keep the conversation going
4. **Immediately add a comment** with your link (NEVER put links in the post body)
5. **Continue engaging** with other people's posts (stay visible)
6. **Check back** 2-4 hours later for more comments
7. **DM people** who engaged deeply ("Thanks for the thoughtful comment!")

## Account Nurturing (Daily Routine)

> LinkedIn rewards consistent professional presence, not just sporadic posting.

### Daily Minimum (20-30 min/day)
- Browse feed: 10 min
- Like 10-15 posts
- Comment on 5-8 posts (thoughtful, 20+ words)
- Share 1 post with added insight
- Accept/send 5-10 connection requests

### Weekly Goals
- 3-5 original posts per week
- 1 carousel (document post) per week 
- Reply to ALL comments on your posts
- Send 5-10 personalized connection requests
- Engage with 2-3 industry leaders' posts

### Growth Pattern
```
Week 1-2: Comment on 10+ posts daily (build visibility)
Week 3-4: Start posting 3x/week + continue commenting
Month 2: Add carousels and story-format posts
Month 3+: Full thought leadership routine
```

### What Makes LinkedIn Comments Valuable
- **50+ words** for maximum visibility (LinkedIn promotes long, insightful comments)
- Add your own perspective or contrarian view
- Share a relevant personal experience
- Ask a follow-up question
- Tag relevant people ONLY if they'd genuinely benefit
- Avoid: "Great post!", "Agree!", emoji-only replies

## Best Practices
- Post 3-5 times per week (consistency > volume)
- Reply to every comment within the first hour
- Tag people only if genuinely relevant
- Share posts from others with added commentary
- Use the LinkedIn mobile app to check formatting

## What to Avoid
- Links in the post body (put in first comment)
- Generic motivational quotes
- Corporate jargon without personality
- Tagging 20+ people for reach (spam behavior)
- Only posting about your product/company
- AI-generated generic content (flagged and reduced reach)
- Excessive automation (leads to account restriction or ban)
