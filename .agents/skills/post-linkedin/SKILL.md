# LinkedIn Posting Skill

## Platform Overview
LinkedIn is the professional networking platform with 1B+ members. It's the best platform for B2B thought leadership, career content, and professional brand building. LinkedIn organic reach is still excellent compared to other platforms.

## Platform Constraints
- **Character Limit**: 3,000 characters per post
- **Media**: Images, videos, documents (carousel PDFs), polls
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 per post (at the bottom)
- **Links**: Put in comments — links in body reduce reach by 25-35%
- **Linkless posts**: Get 6x more reach and 18x more comments than posts with links
- **Videos**: Native video gets 5x more reach than YouTube links
- **Carousels**: Document posts get 2-3x reach
- **80/20 Rule**: 80% native content, 20% with links (in comments)

## AI Content Warning (2025)

> LinkedIn's algorithm now scrutinizes AI-generated content. Overly generic or automated posts get reduced reach. Authentic, human-driven content is strongly prioritized.

- Posts analyzed for AI-generated material
- Generic, template-like content is penalized
- Add personal stories, specific details, and genuine voice to stand out
- Human oversight is essential even when using AI to draft

## Posting Method: MANUAL PASTE

> LinkedIn blocks browser automation via system policy. The agent generates content and saves it to `posts/drafts/linkedin_post.md`. You paste it manually.

### Manual Paste Steps
1. Agent generates LinkedIn-optimized content
2. Content saved to `posts/drafts/linkedin_post.md`
3. User opens linkedin.com in their browser
4. User pastes the content into the post composer
5. User adds any images or documents manually
6. User clicks "Post"

## Content Format

### The Story Post
```
{Hook: surprising outcome or lesson -- 1 line}

{Blank line -- this is critical for the "see more" click}

{Scene setting: where/when this happened}

{The challenge}

{What you tried}

{The turning point}

{The result with specific numbers}

{The takeaway for the reader}

{Engagement question}

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
```

### The Contrarian Take
```
{Bold opening statement}

Here's why most people get this wrong:

{Reason 1 with evidence}

{Reason 2 with evidence}

{What to do instead}

2. {Point}
   -> {Brief explanation}

3. {Point}

Which one resonates most?

### The Carousel (Document Post)
```
Slide 1: Bold hook / title
Slide 2-8: One insight per slide (keep text large)
Slide 9: Summary
Slide 10: CTA (Follow for more, link in comments)
```

## Content Strategy
- **First line is everything**: This is what appears before "see more"
- **Use line breaks**: Short paragraphs (1-2 lines) for mobile readability
- **Be personal**: "I" posts outperform "we" posts
- **Share failures**: Vulnerability drives massive engagement
- **Give away knowledge**: The more you teach, the more authority you build
- **Comment on others**: Thoughtful comments on others' posts build visibility

## Algorithm / Discovery Tips
- LinkedIn shows your post to 10% of connections first
- If that 10% engages, it expands to more connections
- Comments carry 4x the weight of likes
- First 60 minutes are critical for reach (the "golden hour")
- Posts without links get 3x the reach
- Document posts (carousels) get 2-3x the reach
- **Dwell time** (how long users read your post) is a key ranking factor
- LinkedIn now shows older relevant posts (2-3 weeks old) over newer irrelevant ones
- Vertical videos getting increased priority in 2025
- Expertise: consistent posting on niche topics builds algorithmic authority

## Automation Restrictions

> LinkedIn's Terms of Service explicitly prohibit bots and automated methods for accessing the platform.

- Automation can lead to temporary restrictions or permanent bans
- Daily limits (2025): 10-20 connection requests, 50-100 messages
- Spread out actions to mimic natural behavior
- Scheduling content via official tools (LinkedIn's own scheduler) is acceptable

## Hashtag Strategy
| Industry | Recommended Hashtags |
|----------|---------------------|
| Tech/AI | #AI #MachineLearning #TechLeadership |
| Startups | #StartupLife #Entrepreneurship #BuildInPublic |
| DevRel | #DevRel #DeveloperExperience #OpenSource |
| Career | #CareerAdvice #JobSearch #Leadership |

## Best Practices
- Post 3-5 times per week (consistency > volume)
- Reply to every comment within the first hour
- Tag people only if genuinely relevant
- Share posts from others with added commentary
- Use the LinkedIn mobile app to check formatting

## What to Avoid
- Links in the post body (put in first comment)
- Generic motivational quotes
- Corporate jargon without personality
- Tagging 20+ people for reach (spam behavior)
- Only posting about your product/company
- AI-generated generic content (flagged and reduced reach)
- Excessive automation (leads to account restriction or ban)
