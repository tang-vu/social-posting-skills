# IndieHackers Posting Skill

## Platform Overview
IndieHackers is a community of bootstrapped founders and indie makers sharing revenue numbers, lessons, and project updates. Think of it as Reddit specifically for people building profitable side projects and startups. The audience values transparency, real numbers, and practical advice.

## Platform Constraints
- **Format**: Rich text editor (supports basic formatting)
- **Title**: Required for posts
- **Groups**: Posts are organized by topic groups
- **Product Pages**: Separate section for showcasing products
- **No character limit**: But 200-500 words is the sweet spot

## Posting Method: MANUAL PASTE

> IndieHackers may use bot detection which blocks browser automation. The agent generates content and saves it to `posts/drafts/indiehackers_post.md`. You paste it manually.

### Manual Paste Steps
1. Agent generates IndieHackers-optimized content
2. Content saved to `posts/drafts/indiehackers_post.md`
3. Navigate to `https://www.indiehackers.com/new-post`
4. Select a relevant group
5. Fill in title and body
6. Click "Post"

## Content Format

## Content Strategy
- **Be transparent about numbers**: Revenue, users, costs -- real numbers build trust

- **Provide actionable advice**: Not generic motivation
- **Engage with other makers**: Comment on others' posts consistently
- **Weekly cadence**: Regular updates build following

## Algorithm / Discovery Tips
- Posts with real numbers get significantly more engagement
- Consistent posting (weekly updates) builds following
- Commenting on others' posts drives reciprocal engagement

## Best Practices

- Keep updates concise (200-500 words)

## What to Avoid
- Hard selling or pure promotion
- Vague updates without data
- Posting only when you need something
- Generic advice without personal experience
- Ignoring the community (post and ghost)
