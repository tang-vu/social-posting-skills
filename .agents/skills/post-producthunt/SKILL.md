# Product Hunt Posting Skill

## Platform Overview
Product Hunt is the go-to platform for launching tech products and discovering new tools. 10M+ monthly visitors, mostly tech-savvy early adopters, founders, VCs, and journalists. A successful launch can drive thousands of signups in a single day.

## Platform Constraints
- **Product Launch**: One launch per product (can re-launch with major updates)
- **Discussions**: Text posts in community discussion forum
- **Media**: Product screenshots, demo videos, logo (required for launches)
- **Upvotes**: Community-driven ranking system
- **Comments**: Q&A style on product pages

## Posting Method: MANUAL PASTE

> Product Hunt uses Cloudflare bot detection which blocks browser automation. The agent generates content and saves it to `posts/drafts/producthunt_post.md`. You paste it manually.

## Post Types

### 1. Product Launch (Major Event)

**Pre-launch Checklist:**
- [ ] Hunter/maker account verified
- [ ] Product name, tagline (60 chars max), description
- [ ] 4-6 high-quality screenshots or demo GIF
- [ ] Maker comment prepared (first comment explaining your story)
- [ ] Launch day: Tuesday-Thursday (best engagement)

**Tagline Formula:**
```
{What it does} for {who it's for}
```
Examples:
- "AI writing assistant for developers"
- "Open-source analytics for side projects"

**Description Format:**
```
{Problem}: {1-2 sentences about the pain point}

{Solution}: {What your product does differently}

{Key features}:
- Feature 1: {benefit}
- Feature 2: {benefit}
- Feature 3: {benefit}

{Tech stack or unique approach}

{Current status}: {beta, launched, X users, etc.}

We'd love your feedback!
```

**Maker Comment Template:**
```

{What makes this different from alternatives}

```

### 2. Discussion Post

Navigate to: `https://www.producthunt.com/discussions/new`

**Discussion Format:**
```
Title: {Question or topic for discussion}

Body:
{Context: why this matters}

{Your perspective or experience}

{Specific question for the community}
```

## Content Strategy
- **Launch day matters**: Tuesday-Thursday get the most engagement
- **Timing**: Launch at 12:01 AM PST for maximum visibility window
- **Maker engagement**: Reply to every comment personally
- **Cross-promote**: Share your PH launch on X, LinkedIn, and email
- **Social proof**: Ask friends/users to leave genuine comments (not just upvotes)

## Algorithm / Discovery Tips
- Upvotes from PH community members carry more weight
- Comments and discussions boost ranking
- Products with demo videos rank higher
- Consistent engagement throughout the day helps maintain position
- Avoid asking for upvotes (against ToS and penalized)

## Best Practices
- Prepare all assets 1-2 weeks before launch
- Have your maker comment ready before launch goes live
- Reply to every comment within 15-30 minutes
- Share genuine appreciation for engagement
- Post a discussion 1-2 weeks before launch to build awareness

## What to Avoid
- Asking people to "upvote" (creates inauthentic engagement)
- Launching on weekends (lower traffic)
- Copy-pasting generic responses to comments
- Neglecting the product page after launch day
- Launching without screenshots or demo
